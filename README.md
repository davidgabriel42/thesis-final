# Prediction of File Throughput using Darshan Logs on the Blue Waters Supercomputer

## code supporting a thesis for the Masters of Science in Computer Science
## by David Gabriel

This repository contains the code necessary to recreate the figures in my masters thesis, and to 
predict the file I/O rate in bytes/s of the Blue Waters supercomputer, using Darshan logs collected
between Jan 2017 and December 2019. This code also contains data scraped from that dataset, in a
highly compressed and summarized manner, in the raws.csv file included.
